# Load the data
```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
```

The ToothGrowth dataset is packaged with the R download.  This dataset shows the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.  

# Initial exploration

Before evaluating the data, an initial familiarization of the information is necessary.

```{r}
str(ToothGrowth)
summary(ToothGrowth)
```
The structure shows three variables.  Further, the dose looks like it has only a few discrete values.  The assumption can be made that this is a factor.

```{r}
ToothGrowth$dose <- factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
```
